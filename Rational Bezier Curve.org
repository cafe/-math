* Bézier Curve

(From [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BezierCurve.html][MathWord]])

Given a set of n+1 control points P_{0}, P_{1}, ..., P_{n}, the corresponding Bézier curve (or Bernstein-Bézier curve) is given by (in /LaTeX/)

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
C(t)=\sum_{i=0}^n P_i B_{i,n}(t)
#+END_SRC

i.e., 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
        __ n               
C(t) = \         P  B   (t)
       /__ i = 0  i  i,n
#+END_EXAMPLE

where B_{i,n}(t) is a Bernstein polynomial and t in [0,1]. Bézier splines are implemented in the Wolfram Language as =BezierCurve[pts]=. 

* Rational Bézier curve

Given n + 1 control points P_{i} with w_{0} = w_{n} = 1, the "rational" Bézier curve is defined by (in /LaTeX/)

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
C(t)=\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n B_{i,n}(t) w_i P_i}{\sum_{i=0}^n B_{i,n}(t) w_i}
#+END_SRC

i.e., 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        __ n                  
       \         B   (t) w  P 
       /__ i = 0  i,n     i  i
C(t) = -----------------------
         __ n                 
        \         B   (t) w   
        /__ i = 0  i,n     i
#+END_EXAMPLE

or simply (in /LaTeX/)

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
C(t)=\frac {\sum _{i=0}^{n}{n \choose i}t^{i}(1-t)^{n-i} P_{i} w_{i}}
{\sum _{i=0}^{n}{n \choose i}t^{i}(1-t)^{n-i}w_{i}}
#+END_SRC

i.e., 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        __  n                 i       n - i      
       \         {n choose i}t (1 - t)      P  w 
       /__  i = 0                            i  i
C(t) = ------------------------------------------
          __  n                 i       n - i    
         \         {n choose i}t (1 - t)     w   
         /__  i = 0                           i 
#+END_EXAMPLE

where n is the order, B_{i,n} are the Bernstein polynomials, P_{i} are control points, and the weight w_{i} (nonnegative values) of P_{i} is the last ordinate of the homogeneous point P_{i}^{w}. These curves are closed under perspective transformations, and can represent conic sections exactly. 

** Properties:

1. If all w_{i} = 1, then we get the polynomial Bézier curves.
2. C(0) = P_{0}, C(1) = P_{n} (endpoint interpolation)
3. C(t) \subseteq [P_{0}, ..., P_{n}] (convex hull property)
4. The curve is tangent to the control polygon in the endpoints.

** Properties of the weights:

1. For w_{0} = w_{1} = ... = w_{n} = 1, the rational Bézier curve is equal to a polynomial Bézier curve.
2. Multiplication of all weights with a common factor does not change the curve.
3. More generally, if for all ratios
  
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    w    w             
     i    i + 1        
  ------:------ = const
  w      w             
   i + 1  i + 2
   
  LaTeX: \frac{w_{i}}{w_{i+1}}:\frac{w_{i+1}}{w_{i+2}} = const
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  then the curve has the same shape but another parametrization.

4. Increasing the weight w_{k} pulls the curve to the control point P_{k}. Decreasing the weight w_{k} pushes the curve away from the control point P_{k}.
5. In the limit case, when w_{k} approaches infinity, C(t) = P_{k}
