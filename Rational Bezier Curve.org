* Bézier Curve

(From [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BezierCurve.html][MathWord]])

Given a set of n+1 control points P_{0}, P_{1}, ..., P_{n}, the corresponding Bézier curve (or Bernstein-Bézier curve) is given by (in /LaTeX/)

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
C(t)=\sum_{i=0}^n P_i B_{i,n}(t)
#+END_SRC

i.e., 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
        __ n               
C(t) = \         P  B   (t)
       /__ i = 0  i  i,n
#+END_EXAMPLE

where B_{i,n}(t) is a Bernstein polynomial and t in [0,1]. Bézier splines are implemented in the Wolfram Language as =BezierCurve[pts]=. 

* Rational Bézier curve

A "rational" Bézier curve is defined by (in /LaTeX/)

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
C(t)=\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n B_{i,p}(t) w_i P_i}{\sum_{i=0}^n B_{i,p}(t) w_i}
#+END_SRC

i.e., 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        __ n                  
       \         B   (t) w  P 
       /__ i = 0  i,p     i  i
C(t) = -----------------------
         __ n                 
        \         B   (t) w   
        /__ i = 0  i,p     i
#+END_EXAMPLE

where p is the order, B_{i,p} are the Bernstein polynomials, P_{i} are control points, and the weight w_{i} of P_{i} is the last ordinate of the homogeneous point P_{i}^{w}. These curves are closed under perspective transformations, and can represent conic sections exactly.
